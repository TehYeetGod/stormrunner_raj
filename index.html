        <p>The Storm Runner is a book that was written by J.C Cervantes and was published by Rick Riordian. This book was going to be a book by itself but because of the complex storyline the writers had to make it part of a trilogy. The trilogy includes The Storm Runner, The Fire Keeper, and The Shadow Crosser. This book is based on Mayan mythology and it’s powerful gods. This book is an exciting, seat-clenching adventure about a young boy named Zane Obispo who is destined to release and defeat the god of darkness, Ah-Puch.
<br>
<br>
            Let’s learn a little about the characters of this story. Zane Obispo is an introvert and is conscious about his disability, one of his legs being shorter than the other. He lives with his mother in New Mexico in a no-man’s-land. His favorite thing to do is to explore the sleeping volcano in his backyard which he calls “The Beast”. Throughout the story he learns more about himself, who he is and where he came from. In the middle of the story he realizes that he is part-god, his father being Hurakan, the god of storms. His primary companion is his three-legged dog named Rosie whom he finds in the desert. Another character we see in the story is Zane’s uncle Hondo. Hondo lives with Zane and Hondo really likes professional wrestling and Flaming Hot Cheetos. He is also very fit. Zane transitioned from home-schooling to in-person learning at a school where he meets Brooks. Brooks is a girl who tells Zane about a prophecy and how Zane played a major part in it. Apparently in the prophecy Zane was going to release the Mayan god of death, disaster, and darkness named Ah-Puch during an eclipse that was soon to happen. She is a nawal which is a form of shapeshifter. However she can only shapeshift into a hawk. She also located Ah-Puch’s resting place and guided Zane on his journey to defeating him later in the story. When Zane, Brooks and Rosie went into The Beast to explore, Rosie got killed by a demon in there and then got sent to the underworld known as Xib’alb’a. The Next Day, 3 hours before the eclipse Zane heard the cries of Rosie coming from the volcano. It turns out that the magic inside The Beast was impersonating Rosie’s cries in order to draw Zane into the volcano, tricking him into releasing Ah-Puch. Eventually, Brooks followed and they discovered where Ah-Puch’s location is so they decided to go there because they wanted to prevent Ah-Puch from escaping, but the problem with going there is that it’s in a cold lake and Brooks can’t swim, so Brooks had to hold on to Zane’s arm in order to make it down there. They were managing to get good progress on getting to the resting place until something happened. Brooks apparently drowned just before getting there. Zane was very sad about this and he ended up making a deal with Ah-Puch. The deal was that Ah-Puch would restore Brooks and Rosie in exchange for his freedom. Without thinking, Zane accepted the deal and Ah-Puch was free. Ah-Puch is the god of death, disaster, and darkness. He tried to destroy the world but the gods managed to seal him inside of an artifact and keep him imprisoned until Zane showed up.
<br>
<br>            
            Now let us talk about the lore of this story. As you know there was once a great soothsayer who foretold that an innocent would set Ah-Puch free. The gods after hearing this, made it so that only a god could set Ah-Puch free. The soothsayer left out the fact that the innocent was part god so Zane could still manage to set Ah-Puch free. Now about a very important part in the story, the godborns. There were two godborn teenagers called the hero twins and they lied about defeating Ah-Puch long back. The gods believed this and the twins inspired jealousy in the gods, so the gods decided that no more godborns should ever be made. When the soothsayer told the gods that an innocent was going to release Ah-Puch, the gods made it so that only a god could free Ah-Puch. However, Hurakan the god of storms, married Zane’s mom which resulted in the birth of Zane. Since Zane was born to a god he managed to set Ah-Puch free as you know. The story ends with him defeating Ah-Puch but dying in the cause making him go to the underworld. However, Ixtab the god of the underworld agreed to let Zane live again but he had to stay completely incognito because the gods would get mad if they found out that Zane was still alive. This is a very fast-paced and exciting story that keeps the reader completely hooked and wanting more.</p>
